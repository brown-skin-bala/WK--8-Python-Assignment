# COVID-19 Global Data Tracker

This project is a data visualization tool that tracks and analyzes COVID-19 data globally and for selected countries. It provides insights into total cases, deaths, vaccination rates, and other key metrics using interactive visualizations and plots. The tool is designed to help users understand the trends and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

---

## Objectives

- To analyze and visualize COVID-19 data for selected countries.
- To provide insights into the trends of cases, deaths, and vaccinations over time.
- To compare countries based on key metrics such as total cases per million and vaccination rates.
- To create interactive visualizations for better understanding of the data.
- To highlight global and regional disparities in COVID-19 metrics.

## How to Run/View the Project

1. **Install Required Libraries**:
   Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn plotly
   ```

2. **Download the Dataset**:
   - Place the `Covid Data.csv` file in the same directory as the script.
   - Alternatively, the script will automatically download the dataset from the [Our World in Data](https://covid.ourworldindata.org/data/covid-data.csv) website if the file is not found locally.

3. **Run the Script**:
   Execute the Python script using the following command:
   ```bash
   python "Covid19 Global Data Tracker.py"
   ```

4. **View the Outputs**:
   - The script generates multiple visualizations, including:
     - Line plots for trends in total cases, deaths, and vaccinations.
     - Bar charts for comparing countries based on cases per million.
     - Pie charts for vaccination distribution among selected countries.
     - Choropleth maps for global comparisons of cases and vaccination rates.
   - Outputs are displayed interactively or saved for further analysis.

## Insights and Reflections

### Key Insights:
- **Trends**:
  - COVID-19 cases and deaths show distinct trends across different countries, reflecting varying responses and healthcare capacities.
  - Vaccination rates are a critical factor in reducing the spread and severity of the virus.
- **Global Perspective**:
  - Choropleth maps provide a clear visualization of global disparities in cases and vaccination rates.
  - Countries with higher vaccination rates tend to have lower death rates, highlighting the importance of vaccination campaigns.

### Reflections:
- **Data Challenges**:
  - Handling missing data and ensuring data accuracy are crucial for meaningful analysis.
  - Forward-filling missing values for time-series data ensures continuity but may introduce biases.
- **Visualization**:
  - Combining static and interactive visualizations enhances the ability to communicate insights effectively.
  - Tools like Plotly make it easier to explore data interactively, especially for global datasets.

## Future Improvements

- **Additional Metrics**:
  - Include metrics such as recovery rates and testing rates for a more comprehensive analysis.
- **Real-Time Updates**:
  - Integrate APIs to fetch real-time COVID-19 data for up-to-date visualizations.
- **Custom Country Selection**:
  - Allow users to dynamically select countries for analysis instead of using a predefined list.
- **Export Options**:
  - Add functionality to save visualizations as image files or export data for further use.
